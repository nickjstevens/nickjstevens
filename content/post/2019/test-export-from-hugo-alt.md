Type: Note

This is a test page. 

I wanted to understand regular "easy" links: [https://nickjstevens.com](https://nickjstevens.com) links. OK. So easy links get converted to markdown links on export.

As well as markdown links: [https://sudoku.com/easy/](https://sudoku.com/easy/)

And bookmarks:

[Easy sudoku puzzles for free, play web sudoku for beginners](https://sudoku.com/easy/)

I'll also test doing an internal link (in same database): [Hugo](https://www.notion.so/Hugo-f840ae3993bd44bb9493363ff4bfe7d9) 

And via link to page (in same database):

[Hugo](https://www.notion.so/Hugo-f840ae3993bd44bb9493363ff4bfe7d9)

And same for different database: [Import Jan 11, 2020](https://www.notion.so/1ce0b46789164358b3f04b08e36506b4) 

[goodreads_library_export](https://www.notion.so/1ce0b46789164358b3f04b08e36506b4)

Page with space in name: [Exporting from Notion](https://www.notion.so/Exporting-from-Notion-015edf50a5e64655a3f2e5d142563dd5) 

Ultimately i want to experiment with wiki links.
